1. Clone yaCMS: https://github.com/paullik/yaCMS
2. Clone dotophp https://github.com/paullik/dotophp (if you haven't already)
3. Create `index.php` inside your DocumentRoot, in which you define the
   constant YACMS_PATH with the right path to `yaCMS/src/` (with the trailing
   slash) and include `dotophp/src/index.php`
4. That's it, access it through the web browser
